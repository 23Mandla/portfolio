            I'm Mandla Mbolekwa, final year student at Unisa and a software
            developer with a passion for creating and developing web and mobile
            applications. I have a strong interest in software and web

          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to formal education, I have proactively pursued personal
            development opportunities including learning beyond formal education
            and completing a certificate in programming from Udacity

          <p>
            I am currently seeking an internship, entry-level, or part-time
            opportunity where I can demonstrate my programming skills and gain
            hands-on experience.
